# Cats-and-Dog-classifier
This is a simple Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN ) that I use to predict whether images from the "Cats and Dogs" competition on Kaggle are of cats or dogs. 

The source of the cats and dogs data is too large to be uploaded wholesale via Github: please find it at : https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats.

Best of luck with the dataset.
